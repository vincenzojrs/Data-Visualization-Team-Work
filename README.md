# REDDIT - DVIZ Team Work
## Purpose
A network consists in multiple entities that communicate with one another. Our task consisted in choosing one from several network datasets mainly provided by the Stanford Network Analysis Project, visualizing it, analyzing it, and finding a story to tell and valuable insights. We choose the Reddit dataset, consisting in a list of posts on Reddit belonging to a source subreddit and pointing to a target subreddit. A subreddit is a subcommunity characterized by the same topic.

## Design & Methodology
Since each observation had a year timestamp, we conducted a comparative analysis for Reddit in 2014 and the same social 2 years later. Thanks to Gephi, we realized an advanced network visualization, finding the most “important” subreddit, the trends, the niches etc. Using Python, Plotly and NetworkX we got some analytical insights about Reddit.

## Main Findings
In 2014:
* Reddit was a funny place used mainly for entertaining.
* Crypto niches (“dogecoin”) were already substantial!
* 8% of negative posts relating to “popcorn”, “bodybuilding”, and “shitposting”
* The most important subreddits are giant components: they don’t tell what’s the topic of the
post, but work like an aggregator of the type of observations people usually do on Reddit
(“picture”, “askreddit”).
* “Ucraine” was already an issue in 2014!
